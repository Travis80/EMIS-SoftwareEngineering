        <h1>EMIS Project</h1>
        <p>The EMIS or Electronic Medical Information System's purpose is to provide a portal that handles sensitive medical information. This web application is a tool to help a patients' visit to a clinic or hospital. This is done by handling patient records and information for easy access for doctors, nurses, and clinical staff. It also serves as a tool of communication between patients and medical staff allowing for interactions such as patients being able to schedule appointments with doctors through receptionists.</p><br>
